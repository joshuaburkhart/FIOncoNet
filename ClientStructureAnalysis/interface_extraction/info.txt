Hi Josh,

Here is the link for the class I used for protein contact analysis:

I have also zipped all required jar files for this class. You can see the class is copied from a huge project, which is very messy. You can pick up methods related to what you need, most extractContacts(Structure).

For an example how to use, please see method checkInterfaces().

Thanks,

Guanming
