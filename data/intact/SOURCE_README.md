Source-text annotation export for data miners
---------------------------------------------

This directory contains a data file (source-text.txt) that provides a mapping between
IntAct interactions and the sentence(s) of the publication that allowed an IntAct 
curator to identify the interaction.


The file format is as follow:

  Field #1: PubMed identifier of the manuscript from which the interaction was annotated.

  Field #2: Accession number of the interaction in the IntAct database.

  Field #3: Sentence taken from the manuscript (in some cases, special
            characters might have been replaced and format slightly altered).

Fields are separated by a tabulation.
